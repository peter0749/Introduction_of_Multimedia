Information
==============================================================================
The folder hico_20150920/ contains following items:

1. images/ contains two folders:
     1. train2015/:    38116 training images
     2. test2015/:     9658 test images

      All images are resized such that the longer side is at most 640 pixel. 
   There will be a small set of images with longer side less than 640 pixels, 
   since their original length is shorter than 640 pixels.

2. anno.mat contrains all the annotations
    a. list_action  600 x 1 struct      each entry is one HOI category
        - nname:     noun (object)
        - vname:     verb
        - vname_ing: verb with the -ing ending
        - syn:       synonyms
        - def:       definition
        - synset:    corresponding wordnet synset
        - add_def:   additional definition

    b. list_train   38116 x 1 cell      each entry is a file name of an 
                                        (training) image
    c. list_test    9658 x 1 cell       each entry is a file name of an 
                                        (test) image
    d. anno_train   600 x 38116         entry (i,j) is the annotation of 
                                        (training) image j on action i
    e. anno_test    600 x 9658          entry (i,j) is the annotation of 
                                        (test) image j on action i

    Possible annotations:
       +1:  positive
       -1:  negative
        0:  ambiguous
      NaN:  no annotation

    'ambiguous' is assigned due to the disagreement betweem annotators

    'no annotation' incidcates the image is not annotated with the HOI. Most 
      of the images are annotated with the HOIs of one object category only.
